# CSS-Bootstrap-5-exercice
CSS / Bootstrap 5 exercice

--------- This exercice comes from a bootcamp made by Doctor Angela Yu. Some personnalisations and updates have been made by myself -----------

This exercice shows the use of some Bootstrap 5 components :
- Grid ;
- Carousel ;
- Cards.

It also shows the use of some advanced CSS concepts :
- The stacking order logical and z-index ;
- The Media Query Breakpoint functionality ;
- The selector priority (hierarchical and combining selectors) ;
- The law of specificity ;
- Code refactoring in order to keep our code DRY.
